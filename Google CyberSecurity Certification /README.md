### Risk Assessment

#### Scope and Goals

A fictional company *Botium Toys* performs a Risk Assessment in order to understand its CyberSecurity posture. The first step in order to develop a successful assessment starts by outlining what can and 
can't be tested, in order to protect the organization, its members and costumers, followed by the objective of such action, in general, the development of *deliverables*, easy to understand documentation 
even for those with no technical skills (ex: management) aiming to collect support in order to apply changes.  

**Scope**

The scope is not constant from audit to audit, however, once it is clearly defined, only the items presented should be audited. 

In this scenario, the scope is defined as the entire security program at *Botium Toys*. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures.

**Goals**

Creation of outcomes aiming to achieve compliance, identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities within the organization, and understanding processes and procedures failure looking forward to correcting them.
