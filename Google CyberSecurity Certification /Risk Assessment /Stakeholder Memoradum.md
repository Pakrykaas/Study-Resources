# Stakeholder Memorandum 

>TO: IT Manager, CTO, CISO, Stakeholders

>FROM: John Wayne

>DATE: 06/06/2026 

>SUBJECT: Internal risk assessment findings and recommendations 

**Dear responsible team,** 

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations. 

## Scope: 

The following domains are in scope: 

● Business Continuity Plan; 
● Intrusion detection system; 
● SIEM tool; 
● Access controls; 
● Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability; 
● Training and awareness; 
● Laws and regulations; 
● Asset security and logging; 
● Network security; 

The systems will be evaluated for: 

● Current user permissions 
● Current implemented controls 
● Current procedures and protocols 

This audit is designed to ensure that current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols are in place and align with PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements, as well as proving current
technologies are accounted for both hardware and system access. 

## Goals: 

● NIST CSF compliance. 
● Creation of policies to ensure system compliance. 
● Upgrade controls systems. 
● Establish policies and procedures, which includes playbooks with detailed steps. 
● Ensure the company meets compliance requirements. 

## Critical findings *(must be addressed immediately):* 

Multiple controls need to be developed and implemented to meet the audit goals, including: 

● Disaster recovery plans; 
● Encryption (for secure website transactions); 
● IDS; 
● Backups; 
● CCTV; 
● Locks; 
● Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems; 
● Fire detection and prevention systems; 
Policies need to be developed and implemented to meet PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements. 

## Findings *(no immediate addressing need):* 

The following controls should be implemented when possible: 

● NAC; 
● Adequate lighting;
● Locking cabinets; 
● Signage indicating alarm service provider; 
● Least privilege; 
● Summary/Recommendations: 

It is recommended that critical findings regarding compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR be promptly addressed since Botium Toys accepts online payments from customers worldwide, including the E.U. 

Having disaster recovery plans and backups is also critical because they support business continuity in the event of an incident. Integrating an IDS and AV software into the current systems will support our ability to identify and mitigate potential risks, and could help with intrusion detection, since existing legacy systems require manual monitoring and intervention. 

In order to further secure assets housed at "Botium Toys" single physical location, locks and CCTV should be used to secure physical assets (including equipment) and to monitor and investigate potential threats. 

While not necessary immediately, backup policies, usage of encryption and having a time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, and signage indicating alarm service provider will further improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
