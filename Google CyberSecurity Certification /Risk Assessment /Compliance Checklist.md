# Compliance Checklist

### The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)

The FERC-NERC regulation applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. 
Organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. Organizations are legally required to adhere to the 
Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards (CIP) defined by the FERC.

**Explanation:** *Botium does need to comply with FERC-NERC since their main factory has privileged electrical infrastructure, served directly by a nuclear plant.*


### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data
is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

**Explanation:** *Botium does need to comply with GDPR since they have offices in Poland.*


### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

**Explanation:** *Botium does need to comply with PCI DSS, since they process e-payments.*


### The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

HIPAA is a federal law established in 1996 to protect U.S. patients’ health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent.
Organizations have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach.

**Explanation:** *There is no health information collection from Botium.*


### System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)

The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization’s user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels
of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

**Explanation:** *Botium Toys needs to establish and enforce appropriate user access for internal and external personnel to reduce risk ensuring data safety.*
