# Hello and Welcome!
Here I will make sure to share all my knowledge regarding the different areas I dedicate myself to study.

From course notes and diagrams to opinions and book quotes, anything that impacts my perception of the cyber realm will have it's dedicated place here.

Feel free to use, share and notify me if anything is not fully accurate (many things will not be in depth, since I'm still not an expert in any field).
